# WKT Parser for Ruby [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fermuch/WKTParser.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fermuch/WKTParser)


I was reading about [parslet](http://kschiess.github.io/parslet/), and I wanted to try it out, so here's the result!

It only supports simple geometries, but support for complex ones like MULTIPOINT, MULTILINESTRING and MULTIPOLYGON is planned.
